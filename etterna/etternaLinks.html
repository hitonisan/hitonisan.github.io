	  <p>This dictionary describes a solid amount of terminology regarding 4-key rhythm game play and patterns, complete with numerous animated examples. It's not comprehensive, but certainly suffices as an introductory resource for those seeking a better understanding of what's sometimes discussed regarding step charts or playstyles.</p>
