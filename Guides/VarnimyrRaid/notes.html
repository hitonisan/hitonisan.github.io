<h2>Playing with "Effect" Set to Low</h2>
<p>I managed to crash during the final phase of a Crimson Cradle Raid, likely due to the sheer number of effects that were on-screen (note that I was running at 2 FPS or so). As I soon deduced, this broke the back of our Raid group, who I found out of Raid less than three minutes later. My game crashing might have ended the group's Raid attempt.</p>

<p>In turn, I've decided to take a look at how dangerous it really would be to use "Low" effects in each of the Raids. The results of what I saw are below. I still recommend having your "Effect" graphics set to "Medium" unless your Raid is almost unplayable due to a low framerate, and you know all of the Raid attacks well enough to be okay with what's invisible. Just remember that if you do use "Low" effects, keep in mind that not just the boss attacks will be hidden - so will most of yours, as well as some debuff symbols.</p>


<h4>12-5:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calamity Remnants</span>: Dangerous, probably do not attempt</p>
<ul>
	<li>Meteor Rain targeting AND fire is invisible</li>
	<li>Flame Pillar targeting is invisible (the pillar can be seen)</li>
	<li>Fire breath invisible (including the fire on the ground)</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crimson Soul</span>: Dangerous, probably do not attempt</p>
<ul>
	<li>Flame Scythe auras are invisible - quite the problem when they're so big</li>
	<li>Harder to track Soul during Pursuit</li>
	<li>Blue targeting symbol invisible</li>
	<li>Crimson Storm tornado invisible, scythe aura on swipe invisible, only track of earth and Soul's animation shows direction to go towards</li>
	<li>Crimson Memories have invisible bodies (health bars/names are still visible)</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crimson Calamity</span>: Dangerous, probably do not attempt</p>
<ul>
	<li>Meteor Rain</li>
	<li>Fire breath</li>
	<li>Flame Pillar targeting</li>
	<li>You can't see all the Calamity heads all the time, so things like the ground being on fire elsewhere are even more of a problem than they usually would be</li>
</ul>

<h4>12-6:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Thorn Field</span>: Suitable</p>
<ul>
	<li>Nothing is hidden except your own moves/debuffs</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Observers</span>: Do not attempt</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blue laser targeting symbols are hidden, so you don't know who the lasers are aimed at unless you can somehow figure this out from where the Eye is looking... assuming half your group isn't next to you. This could get the whole party killed if you were the target.</li>
	<li>Even if you're alone, lacking blue laser symbols means you can't know when a small Observer is aiming a laser at you without having that Observer on your screen</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crimson Eye</span>: Do not attempt unless solo (dangerous if solo)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blue laser targeting symbols are hidden</li>
	<li>Thorn pillar warnings are hidden, meaning you won't know who the Pillars are going after</li>
</ul>

<h4>12-7:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Malice</span>: Do not attempt</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chaos Orbs are invisible, and since Orbs have randomized patterns, this is certain death unless you're very lucky</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recluse</span>: Reasonable</p>
<ul>
	<li>Flame Pillar targeting symbol is invisible (but not pillar itself) - this is fine if everyone baits the attack properly</li>
	<li>Flame Scythe auras are invisible, which can be dealt with if you can see the Recluse's animations clearly</li>
	<li>Blue teleport symbols are invisible</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dark Recluse</span>: Dangerous</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blue teleport symbols are invisible</li>
	<li>Flame Scythe auras - easy enough to remember their locations, though, especially since it should be easier to see Rossov
	<li>Thorn Pillar warning symbols are invisible, pillars are visible. You have to know this attack's timing in order to deal with it without seeing it, and this is the one attack you absolutely cannot mess up if the Raid is going to go smoothly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reward Cube Pulls</h2>
<p>I believe that I'm starting to own a large enough sample size regarding the Raids' mystic stone reward cubes that I can share my results with you all. These are meant to give general ideas of what you should expect to pull from these cubes. While the sample sizes are decent, they are far from excellent, and may be inaccurate due to luck; I intend to update these when I am able to. Please only use the following to get a general understanding of potential results, not as certainty of what you'll obtain.</p>
